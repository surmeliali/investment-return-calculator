## Project Overview
This project calculates the investment return based on the annual rate, amount of money invested, and the number of years the user wants to invest. It takes three inputs from the user:

- Annual investment rate
- Number of years to invest
- Investment amount

It then returns the investment return step-by-step (year-by-year) based on manual calculations.
