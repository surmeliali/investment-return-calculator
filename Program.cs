Purpose: The purpose of this program is to calculate the investemnt return,
based on the annual rate, amount of money that will be invested and how many
years does user wants to invest. We ask user to enter 3 input;
- annual investment rate
- how many years to invest
- What is the investment amount

and we return the investment return step by step(year by year) based on
manual calculation we made in a function.

NOTE: RUN THE EXE FILE OR 'RUN WITHOUT DEBUGGING' if you use VSCode.
